## Project Description
Motify is a basic Java app to demonstrate my knowledge of MVC, JavaFX, and what I've learned in my Application-Programming class. It's functionality is simple at the moment. 
Currently you are able to signup and login. It allows you to create lists of you favorite songs on Spotify. There was plans to incorporate the Spotify Open API to query and export playlists. 

## Known Bugs
- Logging in will still Sign up a new user, and vice versa, signing up will login an existing user.
    ### To do:
    - Make query page

## Login info

You are able to login with any username and password
If you'd like to use a demo user, you can use:

	- Username: checkmeout
	- Password: password

## Requirements
There are no special requirements to run this application. FYI: It was developed in an IntelliJ workspace.
